# A simple timestamp converter
This is just a simple converter that can convert a date and time to a Unix timestamp or the other way around. There are also buttons that you can click to go to the start or end of a day, week, month or a year and there are also buttons for adding or subtracting a specific time period.

A live version can be found here: https://niklashassdal.github.io/timestamp-converter/
